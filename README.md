# Golden View for Google+

***Golden View for Google+*** is a Chrome extension with 5 (optionally enabled) modules:

  1. **User Mute** - Mutes all posts by specific users.
  2. **Default Circle** – Set a circle as default (instead of Stream).
  3. **Hide Images** – Hide image: original and all shares.
  4. **Hide Comments** – Hide comments (option hide all by default).
  5. **Search With Google** – Search Google+ with Google Search.


Each module is based on a self-contained user script, also authored by Micah Wittman, developed and maintained for cross-platform use (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari). See more information about a module by going to it's code repository as linked to below.

Credit and special thanks goes to Matt Mastracci <http://grack.com/+> for his excellent [Replies and more for Google+](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fgmhgfecnmeljhchgcjlfldjiepcfpea) Chrome extension / [project](http://code.google.com/p/buzz-plus/) which was used as a template to wire-up the original scripts as modules of the Golden View for Google+ extension.
